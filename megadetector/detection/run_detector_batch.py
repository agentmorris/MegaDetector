run_detector_batch.py

Module to run MegaDetector on lots of images, writing the results
to a file in the MegaDetector results format.

https://lila.science/megadetector-output-format

This enables the results to be used in our post-processing pipeline; see postprocess_batch_results.py.

This script can save results to checkpoints intermittently, in case disaster
strikes. To enable this, set --checkpoint_frequency to n > 0, and results
will be saved as a checkpoint every n images. Checkpoints will be written
to a file in the same directory as the output_file, and after all images
are processed and final results file written to output_file, the temporary
checkpoint file will be deleted. If you want to resume from a checkpoint, set
the checkpoint file's path using --resume_from_checkpoint.

Has multiprocessing support for CPUs only; if a GPU is available, it will
use the GPU instead of CPUs, and the --ncores option will be ignored.  Checkpointing
is not supported when using a GPU.

The lack of GPU multiprocessing support might sound annoying, but in practice we
run a gazillion MegaDetector images on multiple GPUs using this script, we just only use
one GPU *per invocation of this script*.  Dividing a list of images into one chunk
per GPU happens outside of this script.

Does not have a command-line option to bind the process to a particular GPU, but you can
prepend with "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 ", for example, to bind to GPU 0, e.g.:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python detection/run_detector_batch.py md_v4.1.0.pb ~/data ~/mdv4test.json

You can disable GPU processing entirely by setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=''.
