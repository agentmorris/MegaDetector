    dir_name_and_rows is a tuple of (name,rows).

    "name" is a location name, typically a folder name, though this may be an arbitrary
    location identifier.

    "rows" is a Pandas dataframe with one row per image in this location, with columns:

        * 'file': relative file name
        * 'detections': a list of MD detection objects, i.e. dicts with keys ['category','conf','bbox']
        * 'max_detection_conf': maximum confidence of any detection, in any category

    "rows" can also point to a .csv file, in which case the detection table will be read from that
    .csv file, and results will be written to a .csv file rather than being returned.

    Find all unique detections in this directory.

    Returns a list of DetectionLocation objects.
