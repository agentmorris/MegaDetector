  # To use ultralytics-yolov5's val.py, we need to use an old version of numpy, 
  # because of the removal of np.int in numpy 1.24.0.  This is only necessary if 
  # you're going to use the full val.py suite in ultralytics-yolov5.  If you pin 
  # numpy here, do it again in the pip section below.

  # ultralytics-yolov5 has a dependency on FreeTypeFont.getsize(), which was
