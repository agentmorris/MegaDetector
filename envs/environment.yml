dependencies:
  # PyTorch is not yet supported in Python 3.12 as of the time I'm writing this 
  # environment file.
  - python>=3.8,<3.12

  # Not imported directly, but we force this version to avoid this issue:

  # https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/123097
  #
  # ...but we do this via pip, since it breaks conda's dependency resolver.
  #
  # - mkl=2024.0
  
  # To use ultralytics-yolov5, we need to use an old version of numpy, because
  # of the removal of np.int in numpy 1.24.0.  Even if we relaxed that requirement
  # or patched np.int, we definitely don't want numpy>=2.0.
  - numpy=1.23.5
    
  # ultralytics-yolov5 has a dependency on FreeTypeFont.getsize(), which was
  # removed in Pillow 10, so we force Pillow < 10.0
